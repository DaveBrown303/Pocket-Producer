	<div id="About_Text">

		<p>Pocket Producer is an interactive website and application that allows user's to create and share their own music while at home, work, or on the go! It is designed to allow users to remix and combine music to create their own songs or mixes. It feature a simple yet solid design, and provides an easy way to play around and get creative with music. In other words you would not have to be a professional DJ to use this app – anyone can do it. This being said it also would not limit the creativity of users to just adding things like simple pre-made drum loops. Any song a person creates or remix’s will have the ability to be completely theirs and completely original. Pocket Producer also features a range of audio effects that can be added to individual instruments. It will allow users to remix existing songs, produce mash-ups of two or more different songs, construct long ongoing mixes, or even create their own completely original piece of music. To add on to all of this the app also works as a social media center. Users will be able to make a profile where they can post their creations and follow other users – similar to sites like SoundCloud. The app is directed at both males and females from a wide range of age. Basically it’s for anyone who enjoys music and wants to do a little more than just listen to it. Pocket Producer also acts as a guide to already established musicians, including a recording device with tuner and metronome, a database of songs, recordings, and samples, and tips, tricks and tutorials directed at a wide range of instrumentals as well as production. </P>
